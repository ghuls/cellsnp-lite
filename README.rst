cellsnp-lite aims to pileup the expressed alleles in single-cell or bulk RNA-seq 
data, which can be directly used for donor deconvolution in multiplexed 
single-cell RNA-seq data, particularly with vireo_, which assigns cells to 
donors and detects doublets, even without genotyping reference.

cellsnp-lite heavily depends on htslib_. 
This program should give very similar results as samtools/bcftools mpileup. 
Also, there are two major differences comparing to bcftools mpileup:

1. cellsnp-lite can now pileup a list of positions, with 
   directly splitting into a list of cell barcodes, e.g., for 10x genome. With 
   bcftools, you may need to manipulate the RG tag in the bam file if you want 
   to divide reads into cell barcode groups.
2. cellsnp-lite uses simple filtering for outputting SNPs, i.e., total UMIs or counts
   and minor alleles fractions. The idea here is to keep most information of 
   SNPs and the downstream statistical model can take the full use of it.

cellsnp-lite is the C version of cellSNP_, which is implemented in Python. Compared to 
cellSNP, cellsnp-lite is basically more efficient with higher speed and less memory usage. 

News
----

The ``Too many open files`` issue has been fixed (since v1.2.0). The issue is commonly 
caused by exceeding the `RLIMIT_NOFILE`_ resource limit (ie. the max number of files allowed 
to be opened by system for single process), which is typically 1024. Specifically, in the 
case of `M` input files and `N` threads, cellsnp-lite would open in total about `M*N` files. 
So the issue would more likely happen when large M or N is given. In order to fix it, cellsnp-lite 
would firstly try to increase the limit to the max possible value (which is typically 4096) and 
then use a fail-retry strategy to auto detect the most suitable number of threads (which could 
be smaller than the original nthreads specified by user).

Mode 2 is now avaliable in cellsnp-lite (since v1.0.0). cellsnp-lite mode 2 is aimed to pileup 
whole chromosome(s) for a single BAM/SAM file.

The command line option ``--maxFLAG`` is now deprecated (since v1.0.0), please use ``--inclFLAG`` and 
``--exclFLAG`` instead, which are more flexible for reads filtering.

Installation
------------

cellsnp-lite is implemented in C. You can install it via conda_ or from this github repo.

* **Method 1: Install via conda (latest stable version)**

Step 1: add config

.. code-block:: bash

  conda config --add channels bioconda
  conda config --add channels conda-forge
  
Step 2: install  

to your current environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install cellsnp-lite
  
or to a new environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda create -n CSP cellsnp-lite     # you can replace 'CSP' with another env name.

.. _conda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/

* **Method 2: Install from this Github Repo (latest stable/dev version)**

cellsnp-lite depends on `zlib`_ and `htslib`_. The two libs should have been installed in 
the system before installing cellsnp-lite. Then to install cellsnp-lite,  

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/cellsnp-lite.git;
  cd cellsnp-lite; 
  make;
  sudo make install;
  
By default, this will build against an HTSlib source tree in ../htslib. You can alter this 
to a source tree elsewhere or to a previously-installed HTSlib by running 
``make htslib_dir=<path_to_htslib_dir>``.  

Besides, if you met the error ``error while loading shared libraries: libhts.so.3`` when 
running cellsnp-lite, you could fix this by setting environment variable ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` 
to proper value,

.. code-block:: bash

  echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<abspath_to_htslib_dir>:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc;
  source ~/.bashrc;
  
Quick usage
-----------

Once installed, check all arguments by type ``cellsnp-lite -h`` (see a snapshot_)
There are three modes of cellsnp-lite:

* **Mode 1: pileup a list of SNPs for a single BAM/SAM file**

Use both ``-R`` and ``-b``. 

Require: a single BAM/SAM file, e.g., from cellranger, a list of cell barcodes,
a VCF file for common SNPs. This mode is recommended comparing to mode 2, if a 
list of common SNP is known, e.g., human (see Candidate SNPs below)

.. code-block:: bash

  cellsnp-lite -s $BAM -b $BARCODE -O $OUT_DIR -R $REGION_VCF -p 20 --minMAF 0.1 --minCOUNT 20 --gzip
  
As shown in the above command line, we recommend filtering SNPs with <20UMIs  
or <10% minor alleles for downstream donor deconvolution, by adding 
``--minMAF 0.1 --minCOUNT 20``

Besides, special care needs to be taken when filtering PCR duplicates for scRNA-seq data by 
setting maxFLAG to a small value, for the upstream pipeline may mark each extra read sharing 
the same CB/UMI pair as PCR duplicate, which will result in most variant data being lost. 
Due to the reason above, cellsnp-lite by default uses a non-DUP exclFLAG value to include PCR 
duplicates for scRNA-seq data when UMItag is turned on.

* **Mode 2: pileup whole chromosome(s) for a single BAM/SAM file**

Don't use ``-R`` but flexible on ``-b``.

This mode requires inputting a single bam file with either cell barcoded (add ``-b``) or a bulk sample:

.. code-block:: bash

  # 10x sample with cell barcodes
  cellsnp-lite -s $BAM -b $BARCODE -O $OUT_DIR -p 22 --minMAF 0.1 --minCOUNT 100 --gzip

  # a bulk sample without cell barcodes and UMI tag
  cellsnp-lite -s $bulkBAM -I Sample0 -O $OUT_DIR -p 22 --minMAF 0.1 --minCOUNT 100 --UMItag None --gzip

Add ``--chrom`` if you only want to genotype specific chromosomes, e.g., ``1,2``, or ``chrMT``.

Recommend filtering SNPs with <100UMIs or <10% minor alleles for saving space and speed up inference 
when pileup whole genome: ``--minMAF 0.1 --minCOUNT 100``.

Note, this mode may output false positive SNPs, for example somatic variants or falses caussed by 
RNA editing. These false SNPs are probably not consistent in all cells within one individual, hence 
confounding the demultiplexing. Nevertheless, for species, e.g., zebrafish, without a good list of 
common SNPs, this strategy is still worth a good try, and it does not take much more time than mode 1.

* **Mode 3: pileup a list of SNPs for one or multiple BAM/SAM files**

Use ``-R`` but not ``-b``.

Require: one or multiple BAM/SAM files (bulk or smart-seq), their according 
sample ids (optional), and a VCF file for a list of common SNPs. BAM/SAM files 
can be input in comma separated way (``-s``) or in a list file (``-S``). 

.. code-block:: bash

  cellsnp-lite -s $BAM1,$BAM2,$BAM3 -I sample_id1,sample_id2,sample_id3 -O $OUT_DIR -R $REGION_VCF -p 20 --UMItag None --gzip

  cellsnp-lite -S $BAM_list_file -I sample_list_file -O $OUT_DIR -R $REGION_VCF -p 20 --UMItag None --gzip

Set filtering thresholds according to the downstream analysis. Please add 
``--UMItag None`` if your bam file does not have UMIs, e.g., smart-seq and bulk 
RNA-seq.


Notes
----------------------

The command line option ``--maxFLAG`` is now deprecated, please use ``--inclFLAG`` and 
``--exclFLAG`` instead, which are more flexible for reads filtering. You could refer to
the explain_flags_ page to easily aggregate and convert all flag bits into one integer. 
One example is that the default exclFLAG value (without using UMIs) is 1796, which is 
calculated by adding four flag bits: UNMAP (4), SECONDARY (256), QCFAIL (512) and DUP (1024).

List of candidate SNPs
----------------------

A quality list of candidate SNPs (ususally common SNPs) are important for mode 1
and mode 3. If a list of genotyped SNPs is available, it can be used to pile up.
Alternatively, for human, common SNPs in population that have been idenetified 
from consortiums can also be very good candidates, e.g., gnomAD_ and 
1000_Genome_Project_. For the latter, we have compiled a list of 7.4 million 
common variants (AF>5%) with this bash script_ and stored in this folder_.

In case you want to lift over SNP positions in vcf file from one genome build 
to another, see our `LiftOver_vcf`_ wrap function.
