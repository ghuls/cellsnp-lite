The scripts for benchmarking of cellsnp-lite v1.2.0 has an old version (v1), whose 
results were submitted to bioRxiv 
[preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.424913v1).
Now the v1 scripts have been moved to a new repo 
[csp-benchmark](https://github.com/hxj5/csp-benchmark) at directory
[scripts/benchmark_v1](https://github.com/hxj5/csp-benchmark/tree/master/scripts/benchmark_v1).

And the latest versoin of benchmarking scripts are also in the 
[csp-benchmark](https://github.com/hxj5/csp-benchmark) repo.
