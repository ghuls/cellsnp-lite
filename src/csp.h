@note   1. To speed up, the caller should guarantee that:
           a) the parameters are valid, i.e. mplp and gs must not be NULL. In fact, this function is supposed to be 
              called after csp_mplp_t is created and set names of sample-groups, so mplp, mplp->hsg could not be NULL.
           b) the csp_pileup_t must have passed the read filtering, refer to pileup_read_with_fetch() for details.
           c) each key (sample group name) in map_sg_t already has a valid, not NULL, value (csp_plp_t*);
              This usually can be done by calling csp_mplp_prepare().
        2. This function is expected to be used by Mode1 & Mode2.
